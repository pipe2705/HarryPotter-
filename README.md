# DOM Magic!

Title: DOM Magic <br>
Type: Homework<br>
Duration: "4:00+"<br>
Creator: Karolin Rafalski<br>
Updates: Tyler Lane<br>
Competencies: create, append/remove elements in the DOM, traverse the DOM, add/remove attributes <br>
Prerequisites: JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>

---

## Intro
You are now a JavaScript wizard and you will no longer hard code HTML during your time at Hogwarts (or the duration of this assignment)! You will make things appear and disappear (and more) with the magic of JavaScript!

This homework is recommended to be done with a Harry Potter theme but if you are unfamiliar with Harry Potter, that's cool, you can make up all your wizard details.

## Setup - Get Ready to Make So Much Magic
Make a folder called `hogwarts` with HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`app.js`) files. Have the HTML file link to the CSS and JavaScript files. The HTML file should be a valid HTML page and have a `<div id="container"></div>` inside the `<body>` tags.

"All my files are linked and loaded"
<hr>

## Year 1
**Important**: As always, use `console.log` all the time and log everything.  But you should remove (or comment out) any logs you no longer need. There will be no further prompts for this advice.

#### In `app.js`
  - Query for your `div` with the `id` of `container` and set it to a variable named `container`
  - Log the `container` object
  - Create an `<h1>` element and set it to a variable called `h1` and log it
  - Add some text inside the `h1` element. Example text: 'Hogwarts'
  - Why isn't your `h1` appearing on your page?

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
 It needs to be appended
 - Append your `h1` to your `container`
</details>

- **It's magic! Isn't it?**

- In your `style.css` file, add a CSS rule where all text will align center inside the `body`

"I added my first element and it was fun"
<hr>

## Year 2
Following what you did in Year 1, add the following:
  - An `h2` element with your name
  - An `h3` element with your house (Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or Slytherin)
  - An `h4` element with your pet's name
    - This `h4` element should have a class with a value of your pet type (owl, cat, toad, etc)
  - Another `h4` element with your wand. You can make it whatever you want. Need help coming up with one? Here is one of many websites to help you find your wand [playbuzz.com](http://www.playbuzz.com/terryraynor10/which-wand-would-you-be-given-in-the-world-of-harry-potter) )
- In your `style.css` add an attribute of `font-family: fantasy;` to all elements that have a class that matches your pet's class

## Year 3
Following what you did in previous years, add the following into an unordered list (with the attribute of `storage` and a value of  `trunk`):
  - List items of
    - Butterbeer
    - Invisibility Cloak (add a class of `secret`)
    - Magic Map (add a class of `secret`)
    - Time Turner (add a class of `secret`)
    - Leash (for your pet, be sure to give this list element the same class as you gave your pet)
    - Bertie Bott's Every Flavor [Jelly] Beans.
  - Append the unordered list to your container div
  - In your `style.css` file give the items with a class of `secret` an attribute of `opacity: 0.5`
  - In your `style.css` file, remove the bullet points from the list items

"Added list elements"
<hr>

## Year 4
You want to show off how many classes you are taking

- Make a table with valid HTML markup: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) has a great example under "More Examples"
  - Right above your table add an `h5` that says 'Spring 2017'
  - Inside the table add a `thead` element
  - Inside the `thead` element add two `th` elements
    - In the first `th` add the text `Day`
    - In the second `th` add the text `Classes`
  - Create a `tr` element and add two `td` elements inside.
    - In the first `td` add the day Monday 
    - In the second `td` add the classes you are taking ( Herbology, Divination, History of Magic, Charms, Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Quidditch practice, etc.)
  - Create more `tr` elements with `td`s inside so that you have Monday - Friday and classes each of those days
  - In your `style.css` file, add a gray 1px solid border around your `table`, `th` elements and `td` elements 
  - In your `style.css` file, add a rule that will center your `table` on the page

<hr>

## Year 5
Things get interesting
  - Break your wand! (select the element that contains your wand and remove it)
  - Class was hard! Drink all your butterbeer! (remove just the butterbeer from your list)
  - Get a new wand (add the same element back with new text describing your new wand. Be sure to insert it after your pet in the DOM)
  - Make your new wand stand out by adding a `color` of `indigo` (or whatever color you like). But do it with magic (aka JavaScript): Don't add the CSS in your `style.css` file
  - Send your pet on a spy mission (remove your pet from the DOM, put it somewhere else in your HTML). Make sure your pet's leash stays in your trunk (list item with the same class as your pet inside the unordered list)
  - Have your pet come back (remove your pet from the DOM, put it back in its original location)

## Year 6
School is so fun!
  - Nosey roommate alert! With the `opacity: 0` CSS property, hide all your belongings with the `secret` class.
    - Your nosey roommate falls asleep 2 seconds later; use `opacity: 0.5` CSS property to reveal all of your belongings with `secret`. (What happens if you also include the `transition: .8s` property?)
  - Accident! You transmogrified your pet's leash into half cabbage
    - Add the class `cabbage` to your pet's leash. Do not replace your pet's leash's original class.  Your pet, which also has the same class should remain unaffected.
    - Add an attribute of `color: chartreuse;` in your `style.css` for all elements that have a class of `cabbage`
    - Fix your pet's leash by removing the class of `cabbage` (be sure to keep your pet's leash's original class)

## Year 7
Though your time at Hogwarts is nearly over, your journey of learning has just begun
  - Update your class schedule to read 'Fall 2018'
  - Celebrate by buying more butterbeer! Append a list item with the text 'Butterbeer' as the first list item inside your unordered list with the value of `trunk`.
  - Whoops! You broke your trunk when you stood on it while singing karaoke. Get a new storage container for your stuff; replace the unordered list's property of `trunk` with a new property of `chest`.
- Add some CSS to your page. Feel free to experiment and make this page your own!

## Post-Graduation (Hungry for More - choose any)
- Research how to and then [add a Favicon](https://bitsofco.de/all-about-favicons-and-touch-icons/)  (it is ok to hard code this in your `index.html`) 
- Refactor your code. Make it more DRY. Are there places you could have used a for loop? Functions you could have created?
- Clean up your code. Check indentation be sure you have plenty of comments
- Add more delays to show your pet leaving and coming back from its mission. 
- Add CSS animations. We haven't covered them yet. Get inspiration [here](http://animista.net/)
